## Business Requirements

The problem to solve is a management of books into a library. As a library admin, I want to be able to:

- Create, update and delete a book entry
- Create, update and delete a category entry
- Create, update and delete an author entry
- List books by category and author

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
1. CRUD for books, author, category using REST API.
2. Validate request parameters
3. Using MongoDB database to store data

### Frontend
1. Allow to select author in book creation from an existent list.
2. Allow to select category in book creation from an existent list.
3. The author name should be showed as Last Name, First Name.
4. Use HTTP request to access the REST API.

### Others
* Source code must be stored in git repository (you can send it as github or bitbucket link, dropbox/google drive public folder, etc. NOTE: our email servers will reject .zip files with source code)
* Candidates are free to use any libraries, however the prerequisites of this challenge is to incorporate Laravel's framework as part of your solution
* Implement unit tests where necessary
* Follow language specific style guidelines (`phplint`, `jslint`, etc.)
